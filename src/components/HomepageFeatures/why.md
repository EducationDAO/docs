## Why Education DAO?

### The advent of public blockchain networks created a fundamental change in how information is generated and shared. 

The catalyst began with Bitcoin, evolved with Ethereum and now a multitude of chains, dapps and innovations exist on blockchain networks.

Previous generations of information technology have often fallen into the pattern of people in silos: **self-contained teams or entities‚Äìbuilding products for consumers**. This means that if we want to gain information about a certain technology, we need to visit the company‚Äôs documentation and resources.  

**Open-source software projects** attempt to provide access to technology tools **outside of such silos**. Because they often lack a funding model, this requires massive amounts of unpaid, invisible, and unappreciated labor. 

One of the **core propositions of blockchain** technology has been the creation of **self-sustaining technology without an external profit motive**.

### With this new reality, we can exchange and reimagine the following:

#### ‚≠ê closed silos for open communities, 

#### üåü centralized platforms for open-source protocols that work the same for everyone, and

#### üå† consumers for builders and community stakeholders.

Public blockchains allow for information to be **stored and accessible indefinitely.** What‚Äôs more, they allow for us to have **objective trust** about how that information is changed, and by whom: because **all those changes and their attributions are open and public**.

Ironically, most of the information about how we‚Äôre building this technology is housed in **legacy centralized systems**, subject to the same whims of **impermanence, censorship, and loss** that the rest of the Internet has. If this doesn‚Äôt sound familiar, ask yourself: **what happened to all the content on MySpace?**
